  abstract =      {We revisit the transmission mechanism of monetary
                   policy for household consumption in a Heterogeneous
                   Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model. The model yields
                   empirically realistic distributions of household
                   wealth and marginal propensities to consume because
                   of two key features: multiple assets with different
                   degrees of liquidity and an idiosyncratic income
                   process with leptokurtic income changes. In this
                   environment, the indirect effects of an unexpected
                   cut in interest rates, which operate through a
                   general equilibrium increase in labor demand, far
                   outweigh direct effects such as intertemporal
                   substitution. This finding is in stark contrast to
                   small- and medium-scale Representative Agent New
                   Keynesian (RANK) economies, where intertemporal
                   substitution drives virtually all of the transmission
                   from interest rates to consumption.},
